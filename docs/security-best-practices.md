# Security Best Practices for Charli3 Node Operator Backend

Ensuring the security of your Charli3 node is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the oracle network. This guide outlines best practices for securing your node operator backend.

## 1. Server Security

### 1.1 Operating System
- Keep your operating system updated with the latest security patches.
- Use a minimal server installation to reduce attack surface.
- Enable and configure a firewall (e.g., UFW on Ubuntu).

### 1.2 User Management
- Use a non-root user for daily operations.
- Implement strong password policies.
- Use SSH key authentication instead of passwords when possible.

### 1.3 SSH Configuration
- Disable root login via SSH.
- Use a non-standard SSH port.
- Implement fail2ban to protect against brute-force attacks.

## 2. Docker Security

### 2.1 Docker Installation
- Always use the official Docker installation methods.
- Keep Docker and Docker Compose updated to the latest stable versions.

### 2.2 Container Security
- Run containers with the least privileges necessary.
- Use user namespaces to map container users to host users.
- Regularly update base images and rebuild your containers.

### 2.3 Network Security
- Use Docker's built-in network features to isolate containers.
- Avoid exposing container ports unless absolutely necessary.

## 3. Charli3 Node Security

### 3.1 Configuration Security
- Keep your `dynamic_config.yml` file secure and with restricted permissions.
- Never commit sensitive information (like mnemonics) to version control.

### 3.2 Mnemonic Protection
- Store your mnemonic phrases securely, preferably in an offline, encrypted format.
- Consider using a hardware security module (HSM) for key management.

### 3.3 API Security
- Use HTTPS for all external API connections.
- Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## 4. Network Security

### 4.1 Firewall Configuration
- Only open necessary ports (e.g., SSH, Docker API if needed).
- Use IP whitelisting where possible.

### 4.2 VPN Usage
- Consider using a VPN for remote management.
- Implement network segmentation to isolate critical components.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging

### 5.1 System Monitoring
- Implement comprehensive system monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- Set up alerts for unusual system behavior or resource usage.

### 5.2 Log Management
- Centralize and secure all logs.
- Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.

## 6. Backup and Recovery

### 6.1 Regular Backups
- Implement a robust backup strategy for all critical data.
- Store backups securely, preferably off-site.

### 6.2 Disaster Recovery Plan
- Develop and regularly test a disaster recovery plan.
- Document all recovery procedures.

## 7. Access Control

### 7.1 Principle of Least Privilege
- Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to users and processes.
- Regularly audit and revoke unnecessary permissions.

### 7.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implement MFA for all critical access points where possible.

## 8. Updating and Patching

### 8.1 Regular Updates
- Keep all software components updated, including the OS, Docker, and Charli3 node software.
- Subscribe to security advisories for all used components.

### 8.2 Patch Management
- Develop a patch management strategy.
- Test patches in a non-production environment before applying to production.

## 9. Incident Response

### 9.1 Incident Response Plan
- Develop an incident response plan.
- Regularly conduct security drills to test the plan.

### 9.2 Communication Protocol
- Establish a clear communication protocol for security incidents.
- Know how to contact the Charli3 support team in case of security issues.

## 10. Alert Notification Channel Security

### 10.1 Slack Webhook Security
- Use a dedicated Slack workspace for node operations.
- Create a private channel for receiving alerts.
- Regularly rotate the webhook URL.
- Monitor the webhook usage for any unauthorized access.

### 10.2 Discord Webhook Security
- Use a dedicated Discord server for node operations.
- Create a private channel for receiving alerts.
- Regularly rotate the webhook URL.
- Enable 2FA for all Discord accounts with access to the alert channel.

### 10.3 Telegram Bot Security
- Use a dedicated Telegram bot for alerts.
- Create a private group for receiving alerts.
- Regularly rotate the bot token.
- Implement a whitelist of allowed chat IDs.

### 10.4 General Alert Security
- Limit access to alert configuration files.
- Encrypt sensitive information in alert payloads.
- Regularly audit alert logs for any suspicious activity.

## 11. Reward Collection Address Management

### 11.1 Address Security
- Use a dedicated Cardano address for reward collection.
- Consider using a hardware wallet for storing the private keys of the reward collection address.
- Regularly monitor the address for unexpected transactions.

### 11.2 Private Key Management
- Store the private key or seed phrase for the reward collection address offline.
- Use a secure, encrypted storage solution for any digital copies.
- Consider using multi-signature wallets for additional security.

### 11.3 Transaction Monitoring
- Implement automated monitoring of transactions to and from the reward collection address.
- Set up alerts for any unexpected transactions or attempts to access the address.

### 11.4 Regular Audits
- Conduct regular audits of the reward collection process.
- Verify that all collected rewards match expected amounts.
- Investigate any discrepancies immediately.

## Conclusion

Implementing these security best practices will significantly enhance the security posture of your Charli3 node. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and it's crucial to stay informed about new threats and continuously improve your security measures.
